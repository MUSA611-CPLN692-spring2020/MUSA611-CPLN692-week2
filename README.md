#### Project

We're producing a simple map to help people find health centers in the
Philadelphia area. Our application has a few goals. (Full instructions in
the assignment's [index.html](assignment/index.html))

* On application start, use `console.log` to show an array of arrays
  in which the first sub-array contains keys and the rest of the arrays
  contain the 'rows' of our data
* All and only markers found within the zip code range from 19140 to
  19149 should appear
* Each marker should have custom content that comes up in a dialog when
  clicked which tells us the location name

#### Stretch goal

Some health centers offer dental services as well. Can you find a way to
give centers that provide dental services a different icon than those
that do not?
