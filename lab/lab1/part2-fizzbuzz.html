    # Lab 1, Part 2 â€” FizzBuzz

    ## Introduction

    Write a program that uses console.log to print the numbers from 1 to 100.
    For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples
    of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are
    multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

    Believe it or not, this is a common programming challenge in job interviews.

    for (i = 1; i < 101; i = i + 1) {

      if (i % 3 == 0) {
        console.log('Fizz')
      }
      if (i % 5 == 0 & i % 3 == 0 ) {
        console.log('FizzBuzz')
      }
    }
