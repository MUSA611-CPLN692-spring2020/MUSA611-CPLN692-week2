      # Lab 2, Part 5 â€” Convert CSV to JSON

      ## Introduction

      Creating this week's homework assignment, it was necessary to convert the data stored in
      healthCentersCSV from its native format (CSV) to JSON. This is a difficult task partially because
      it is hard to think about all of the edge cases you might encounter and partially because
      datasets are so rarely 'clean'.

      Try your hand at a simplified version of this task:
      For each row in the 'CSV' (instead of separate lines, our 'CSV' is broken up by semicolons),
      console.log an array with all columns separated into different fields and all lines represented
      as separate arrays.

      For example, given the row "I'm,a,little,teapot", you will print out ["I'm", "a", "little", "teapot"].

      Hint: It might be useful to structure this data as an array of arrays. The outer array represents
      all the rows of our CSV, while each inner array represents one such row.

      Hint 2: Check out this method that all strings have (practice using it on small, simplified examples!):

      /* =====================

      Start code

      // feel free to comment this line out if it is too noisy in your console!
      console.log(healthCentersCSV)

      // all columns separated into diff fields and all lines as separate arrays
      entries = healthCentersCSV.split(';');
      var final = [];
      for (var i=0; i<entries.length; i++){
        final.push(entries[i].split(','));
      }

      /* =====================

      End code
