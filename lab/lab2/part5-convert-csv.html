      # Lab 2, Part 5 — Convert JSON to CSV

      ## Introduction

      Creating this week's homework assignment, it was necessary to convert the data stored in
      healthCentersCSV from its native format (CSV)to JSON. This is a difficult task partially because
      it is hard to think about all of the edge cases you might encounter and partially because
      datasets are so rarely 'clean'.

      Try your hand at a simplified version of this task:
      For each row in the CSV, console.log an array with all columns separated into different fields.

      For example, given the row "I'm,a,little,teapot", you will print out ["I'm", "a", "little", "teapot"].

      /* =====================

      Start code

      console.log(healthCentersCSV)

      /* =====================

      End code
